% Facts about planets
planet(mercury, distance_sun(0.39), mass(0.0553)).  % Distance in AU, Mass in Earth masses
planet(saturn, orbital_period(29.46), day_length(0.45)).  % Orbital period in Earth years, Day length in Earth days

% Rule to find the distance between two planets based on their positions from the Sun
distance_between(Planet1, Planet2, Distance) :-
    planet(Planet1, distance_sun(Distance1)),
    planet(Planet2, distance_sun(Distance2)),
    Distance is abs(Distance1 - Distance2).
