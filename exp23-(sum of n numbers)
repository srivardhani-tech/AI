% Base case: sum of integers from 1 to 0 is 0
sum_up_to_n(0, 0).

% Recursive case: sum of integers from 1 to n is n plus the sum of integers from 1 to n-1
sum_up_to_n(N, Result) :-
    N > 0,
    N1 is N - 1,
    sum_up_to_n(N1, SubResult),
    Result is N + SubResult.

output:
?- sum_up_to_n(10,Result).
Result = 55
